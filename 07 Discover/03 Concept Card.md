## Concept card

A concept card is a one-page summary to help stakeholders, interested parties and the project/product team to understand the:

- Business idea - if we do 'x' then 'y' will happen
- Who it impacts, i.e. which customers
- Why it is needed - the business driver
- Why the idea will be successful - reasons for confidence
- Approach - What we are going to do and how it will be delivered
- Post Launch considerations such as validation of success criteria, how to optimise, marketing, impacts upon business teams/processes.
