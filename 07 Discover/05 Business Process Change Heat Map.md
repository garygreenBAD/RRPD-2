## Business process change heat-map

A diagram to show the differences in business process to current state

This stage provides a one-page visual reference to:

- Highlight any changes to current business process as part of wider product/project delivery.

The idea is to ensure that all impacts of the forthcoming delivery are captured to prevent focus purely being upon the customer and technical landscape. This helps to facilitate meaningful conversations where a whole company and customer focus can be obtained to avoid last minute problems.

Changes to current capabilities are documented with a heat-map to show:

- New processes to introduce
- Changes to existing processes
- Removal/replacement of existing processes

This helps to derive actions such as the need for staff training, redeployment etc.
