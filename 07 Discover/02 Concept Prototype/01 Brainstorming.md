### Brainstorming

Brainstorm as many ideas as possible to help to achieve your chosen mission or strategy.

#### Steps

1. Think of an idea. Write it down or draw it on a Post-It note
2. Place your idea on the board in front of the team who are brainstorming.
3. Tell your team what your idea is all about as you place it on to the board. This stimulates their thoughts for other ideas or how to extend / enhance yours.
4. Keep going, the idea is to create as many ideas as possible. Don't worry if you think they're low value or duplicates, the next steps take care of that!

### Bundle ideas

Now that you’ve got lots of ideas, it’s time to combine them into robust solutions.
Bundling Ideas takes you from strong individual concepts to solutions of substance. Think of it as a game of mix and match, with the end goal of putting the best parts of several ideas together to create more complex concepts. You’ll probably notice that many ideas start to resemble each other—which is a good thing. Try combining them; keep the best parts of some, get rid of the ones that aren't working, and consolidate your thinking into a few concepts you can now start to share with the world.

#### Steps

1. You’ve got lots of drawings and ideas up on the wall, so now it’s time to start moving them around and forming them into more complex solutions.
2. Start by clustering similar ideas into groups. Talk about the best elements of those clusters and combine them with other clusters.
3. Now, start building groupings out of the Themes and patterns you’ve found. Focus on translating what you’ve heard into practice, rather than just identifying similar ideas
4. Once you’ve got a few idea groupings, ask yourself how the best elements of your thinking might live in a system. Now you’re moving from individual ideas to full-on solutions!

### Create a concept

Move from a handful of ideas and insights into a fully-fledged concept, one that you’ll refine and push forward.
So far you’ve come up with, shared, and even discarded scores of ideas. You further refined things as you Bundled Your Ideas and now it’s time to turn them into a Concept. A Concept is more polished and complete than an idea. It’s more sophisticated, it’s something that you’ll want to test with the people you’re designing for, and it’s starting to look like an answer to your mission or strategy. This is the moment where you move from problem to solution and it drives everything that comes next.

#### Steps

1. Take the ideas that you bundled in Bundle Your Ideas and put them up in the wall on Post-its.
Don’t worry too much about all the details of your solution now—you don’t need a finely tuned funding strategy just yet. 
2. The goal is to get a robust, flexible Concept that addresses the problem you’re trying to solve.
3. Keep referring back to your mission or strategy. Are you achieving it? Are there elements missing in your solution What else can you incorporate to come up with a great solution?
4. Like the rest of human-centered design, there’s a bit of trial and error here. And Creating a Concept means you’ll 
probably create a couple that don’t work out. That’s fine.
