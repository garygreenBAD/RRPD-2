### Design principles

As you build out your ideas, you’ll notice that certain unifying elements are starting to guide the design. 
Here’s how to recognise them.

Think of Design Principles as the guardrails of your solution — quick, memorable recipes that will help keep further iterations consistent. These principles describe the most important elements of your solution and give integrity and form to what you’re designing. You’ll also find that they’ll evolve as you design things, so don’t be afraid to revise them. Keep them short and memorable, like, “Talk like people talk,” “The service always connects to the community,” or “Keep women at the center of business.” Lower-level ideas like “The logo should be blue” 
or “We offer discounts” are not Design Principles.

#### Steps

1. Look at your Post-its, and try to derive themes in particular.
2. Consider the core principles underpinning those themes. Frame these as positive statements that might tell you how and what to design. Remember, Design Principles operate as a group, and it’s likely that you’ll need to identify several.
3. Look at the Design Principles you’ve come up with. Are they short and to the point? Do they describe just one idea? Try to avoid overly complicating them. If it feels like there are multiple ideas going on, break them into smaller parts.
4. Review your Design Principles and make sure they cover the key aspects of your solution. Modify any that don’t.
5. Be ready to revise your Design Principles as you start to build Prototypes and test your ideas. Some Design Principles won’t reveal themselves until you’ve actually designed something, but once you spot them they’ll quickly become essential.

### £100 Design experiment

Once you've created your concepts, it makes sense to play these out in front of customers to find out how they interact with them, i.e. will they work?

#### Steps

1. Assume you only have £100, but need to prove whether your concept will work
2. Build a design prototype within these confines, which could be in the form of paper prototypes, Axure prototypes, HTML transitions of designs using POP etc- Maximum of 2 hours.
3. Go to a coffee-shop, e.g. Starbucks armed with £30. Buy 10-15 customers a coffee for 5 minutes of their time to "test drive" your prototype. 

  Record findings to validate or invalidate the idea, i.e. to measurably prove it's viability or to provide alternative suggestions to achieve the desired goal.

#### How

- **Suggested Time:** 120-240 minutes
- **Level of Difficulty:** Expert
- **Materials Needed:**
  - Mocked-up concepts
  - Paper prototype /
  - Axure prototype /
  - HTML prototype /
  - POP (app) prototype
- **Participants:**
  - Product Owner
  - Digital Designer

### Record results

Determine the best way forward, or not! Now might be the time to stop if the concept proved the product would fail!

If the concept succeeded, the results of this need to be documented to inform into the next phase of delivery, which is to assess the technical impact of the proposed change.

#### How

- **Suggested Time:** 60 minutes
- **Level of Difficulty:** Moderate
- **Materials Needed:**
  - Mocked-up concepts
  - Paper prototype /
  - Axure prototype /
  - HTML prototype /
  - POP (app) prototype
  - Notes from observations taken during £100 Design Experiment phase
- **Participants:**
  - Product Owner
  - Digital Designer
  - Business Analyst
