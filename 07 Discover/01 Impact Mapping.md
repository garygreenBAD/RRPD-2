## Impact Mapping

Impact Mapping, is a quick way to ratify with stakeholders that the direction the project is taking will deliver the benefits, by focusing on how the investment will ultimately lead to the desired goal of the project.
It does this by answering 4 questions:

- **Why are we doing the project?**
- **Who will give us these benefits?**
- **How will they do this for us?**
- **What do they need us to give them in order for them to do that?**

Impact mapping will help to drive out the project Themes and could be integrated in other aspects of customer centric methodologies often found in organisations (such as personas, focus groups, Kano modelling, etc.) in order to gain confidence that the investment will return the project benefits.
 
### Author's Definition

Impact Mapping was created by Gojko Adzic who describes it as:

>"Impact mapping is a strategic planning technique. It prevents organisations from getting lost while building products and delivering projects, by clearly communicating assumptions, helping teams align their activities with overall business objectives and make better roadmap decisions.

>Our products and projects do not work in a vacuum. They have an interdependent, dynamic relationship with people, other projects, the organisation and the wider community around them. Yet currently popular planning methods either expect the world to stand still while we deliver or give up on creating any kind of long-term big-picture view, leaving a huge communication gap between business sponsors and delivery teams. Impact maps visualise the dynamic relationship between delivery plans and the world around them, capturing the most important assumptions as well as delivery scope. They help us adapt plans effectively and react to change, while still providing a good road map for delivery teams and a big-picture view for business sponsors.

>Impact mapping helps to reduce waste by preventing scope creep and over-engineered solutions. It provides focus for delivery by putting deliverables in the context of impacts they are supposed to achieve. It enhances collaboration by creating a big-picture view that business sponsors and delivery teams can use for better prioritisation and as a reference for more meaningful progress monitoring and reporting. Finally, it helps to ensure that the right business outcomes are achieved, or that unrealistic projects are stopped before they cost too much, by clearly communicating underlying assumptions and allowing teams to test them".
