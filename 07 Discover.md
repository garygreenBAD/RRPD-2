# Step 4 - Discover - Is the idea viable?

Prototype a range of options prior to commencing delivery

Sometimes business requirements aren't clear, there might be many ways to solve a particular business or customer problem, or delivery could be prohibitively expensive to validate, i.e. sometimes a MVP can entail many months of work. If this is the case then start here by defining a product. The output comes as:

- A set of hypotheses
- Key metrics
- A number of rapidly created prototypes 

_This is a rapid learning stage (2 days ideally, 2 weeks maximum) that comes prior to delivery. The stage concludes when an optimal solution has been determined through validating measurable user feedback versus estimated technical size, scope and complexity. The cost of this stage should be very low ~2-5% of the total cost of delivery_

The "Discover" stage focuses upon the commencement of the delivery phases for a specific tactic/idea. At this stage not all of the team is involved, to keep costs low. Typical representation would be from the Product Owner, Business Analyst, Technical Lead supported by team members as and when required.
