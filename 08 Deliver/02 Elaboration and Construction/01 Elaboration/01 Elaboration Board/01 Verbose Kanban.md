#### The Verbose Elaboration Kanban Board

[TODO] Image

Our Elaboration boards have the following statuses:

* **Product Backlog** - This is a holding area for PBI's (Product Backlog Items) as Stories, Tasks, Bugs or Spikes.  These are initially created as place-holders in the Inception phase.
* **Coming next** - This is a holding area where the Product Owner (or Proxy) prioritises the next tranche of PBI's for Elaboration.
* **Analysis In / Done** - Analysis is where the 3 Amigos for the PBI work together to understand the scope of the PBI.  It's also important to identify what's not in scope too.
* **Elaboration In / Done** - Where we explore potential solutions and decide upon one to try.
* **Test analysis In / Done** - Where we document acceptance criteria, how we will measure the PBI as done.

**Defining done**

How do we know when we've done enough?  As a team agree a Definition of Done for each set of columns.  Here's an example:

* **Analysis In / Done**
  * Scope is defined by the 3 Amigos (see 3 Amigos section)
  * Out of scope is defined (and potentially raised as another PBI)
  * If a User Story, story is defined in form: _As a **role / persona** I would like to **perform an action / feature / use case** so that I can **achieve a benefit**_
  * High-level acceptance criteria scenarios are defined (probably as a bullet list)
  * PBI is estimated - if too large, split into multiple PBIs
  * Verify against INVEST (see INVEST section for more details)
* **Elaboration In / Done**
  * Potential solutions are explored by the 3 Amigos
  * Solution approach agreed by 3 Amigos
  * Initial solution approach defined as bullet list
* **Test Analysis In / Done**
  * Test scenarios are explored by the 3 Amigos
  * Tests are added to PBIs (if a Story we regularly use Gherkin Script to define the test scenarios)
  * PBIs are reviewed by the team to decide if ready
  * PBIs are re-estimated by the team
  * Verify against INVEST
