#### Inventory

How many PBIs should we hold ready for a construction increment?  The rule of thumb we use is that, at the start of every increment or Sprint, there should be around two increments worth of PBI's ready for that increment.

The key reason for this is that teams often skip PBIs due to dependencies or other reasons.

We don't want much more than two increments worth, otherwise we start stockpiling inventory that may go stale.  That is; priorities change, decisions and discussions are forgotten, requirements change.  If we have too many PBI's stockpiled there is a high chance that we will have waste.
