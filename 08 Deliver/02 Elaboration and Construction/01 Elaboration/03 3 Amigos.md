#### 3 Amigos

Elaboration & Construction is a team sport, during Elaboration, however, it's often impractical for the whole team to perform the Elaboration.  Instead we often use the 3 Amigo concept to ensure that we have the key 3 perspectives involved.  The 3 Amigos refer to 3 key roles that work together on PBI's:

- The Product Owner, Business Analyst or Product Owner proxy - defines the value
- A developer or engineer - helps understand potential solution approaches
- A tester - helps define how we measure the PBI as done

> **Warning** - Please work together as a team, elaboration is not intended that the Product Owner does analysis, the engineer elaboration and the tester test analysis.  It is intended that this is done as a team, ideally at the physical elaboration board and ideally lasting minutes per PBI.
