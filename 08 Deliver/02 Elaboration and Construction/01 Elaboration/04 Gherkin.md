#### Gherkin

We often use Gherkin syntax when writing acceptance criteria.  It has two major benefits:

1. It provides documentation on the behaviour of the product.
1. It helps the team understand the true scope of a PBI and minimises risks of misunderstanding the requirement
1. It can be implemented as executable, automated tests utilising BDD (Behavioural Driven Development) tools such as Cucumber and jBehave.

Format:

> Given **a known start state**

> When **I perform a set of actions**

> Then **an expected result with ensue**
