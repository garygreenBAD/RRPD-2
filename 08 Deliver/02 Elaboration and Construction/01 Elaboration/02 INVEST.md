#### INVEST

INVEST is an acronym for:

- **Independent** - The PBI can be delivered without dependency
- **Negotiable** - The PBI is flexible and scope / solution can be negotiated during Construction
- **Valuable** - The PBI has some measurable value
- **Estimatable** - We can size the PBI
- **Sized appropriately** - Fits within a Construction increment
- **Testable** - We can measure it as done

> **Please Note:** Often the challenge with incremental delivery is Independence of PBIs, for example; I need to create the dashboard before I add all the widgets to it.  Value can also be a challenge, especially with architectural enablers, like installing a CMS (Content Management System) and the content comes later.  INVEST is intended as a guide, not a mantra.  So don't sweat these, just be conscious of dependencies and try to deliver customer value as well as technical components.
