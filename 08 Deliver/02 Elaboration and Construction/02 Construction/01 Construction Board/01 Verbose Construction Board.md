##### Verbose Contruction Sprint Board

[TODO] Image

Our Construction boards have the following statuses:

* **Ready for Sprint** - PBIs that have completed Test Analysis and are ready for a construction increment
* **Sprint Backlog** - PBIs that have been brought into the construction increment at Sprint Planning
* **Implementation In / Done** - PBIs that are being developed
* **Deployed to Test** - PBIs deployed to a controlled test environment
* **Exploratory Test In / Done** - PBIs that are being exploratory tested
* **UAT In / Done** - PBIs that are being tested by users / Product Owner / stakeholders
* **Done** - PBIs ready for release to production

**Definitions of Done**

Again, having the team define clear Definitions of Done (DoD) is very healthy and helps guide the team in Construction.  Here's an example of a potential DoD

* **Implementation In / Done**
  * Unit Testing completed successfully
  * Developer testing completed successfully
  * Code has been peer reviewed
  * Solution has been reviewed by the tester
  * Tester approves for PBI to be released to test environment
* **Deployed to Test**
  * Deployed with no errors
  * Smoke / light weight integration test pack passed
* **Exploratory Test In / Done** 
  * Exploratory testing passed
  * Tester has reviewed with Product Owner or proxy
  * Product Owner or proxy approves release to UAT environment
* **UAT In / Done**
  * Product Owner or proxy approves the PBI

> **Experiment:**  The chain above does not have to run sequentially.  What if the Developer and Tester paired on the PBI?  What if the Product Owner reviews as it is built, say after the Daily Scrum?
