#### Metrics

So how do we know how we're doing?  Metrics can be a powerful indicator of performance and culture.  We often use 2 main catagories of metrics:

- Quantative
- Subjective

**Quantative - Predicatability**

Sharing team velocities to stakeholders that do not wholly understand Agile delivery can be dangerous.  They are often compared and should never be.  We prefer predictability.

Predictability has two measures, the Story Points planned for a Sprint and the number of Story Points delivered.

> Predictability = Delivered Points / Planned Points

What does this tell us and what does good look like?  We're looking for 70%-80% to 120%-130% predictable.  Not any higher.  Predictability build trust, helps us plan more effectively and helps build the team's self worth.

Mature teams may use number of Stories, rather than points.

**Quantative - Cycle Time**

Cycle time is the time it takes to flow across a board.  We ususally have two cycle time measures; Elaboration cycle time and Construction cycle time, in days.

What does good look like?  Normally, the lower, the better!  1 day cycle times are awesome.

**Subjective - Squad Health Check**

Consider running a quarterly Squad Health Check.
