### Elaboration

The goal of Elaboration is to decompose Epics into Stories, Tasks and Spikes and get those ready for Sprints.  Elaboration is continuous and supported by a Kanban board to help visualise flow.  The goal of elaboration is to get PBI's ready for a team to construct in a Sprint.  It is not a heavy analysis / design phase, it is intended to do just enough to get PBI's ready and no more.  How much is enough is, very much, dependent on the team performing Elaboration & Construction.  We want to minimise the risk of problems in Construction.

> **Experiment:** Try Elaboration daily, 30 minutes to 1 hour every morning.  Ideally, just before or after the Daily Scrum, before the work of the day has begun.  Do it at a physical Kanban board, with the 3 amigos (BA/PO, Developer, Tester) in front of the team, so those interested can interject.  Have a goal like get x PBIs across the Elaboration Board in the session.
