## Elaboration & Construction

Deliver many short iterations producing a potentially consumable solution each iteration.

The Elaboration and Construction phase is the period of time during which the required functionality is built. The timeline is split up into a number of time-boxed iterations. The initial iterations should be focused upon proving the team, its capability, speed of delivery and architectural approach through the delivery of an Alpha, after which beta delivery commences. At the end of each iteration a demonstrable increment of a potentially consumable solution has been produced and regression tested.

_This phase will initially deliver a MVP and will continue until the product is no longer viable to evolve, hence 'End of Life' activities begin. The cost of this stage represent the majority of the total cost of delivery, ~70-80%._
