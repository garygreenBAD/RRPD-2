### Flexing the roadmap

As you begin to deliver, the Epic roadmap will need to change.  Epics will be split, Epics will be added and Epics will be removed.  This is normal for any Agile Backlog.  The pace or velocity of the teams will change, hopefully improve over time.  All these changes will impact the roadmap.  We recommend that a new roadmap is published monthly.
