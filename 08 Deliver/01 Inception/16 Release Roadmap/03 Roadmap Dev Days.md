#### Roadmap based on developer days

Using developer capacity, we can identify and initial developer velocity.  Let's say for example we have 4 developer, allowing for holidays, team meetings, etc., working 16 days per calendar month; that's 64 developer days per month.

If we have 1,000 Developer Days worth of Epics in the Epic Backlog, then it will take 16 months to deliver them all.
