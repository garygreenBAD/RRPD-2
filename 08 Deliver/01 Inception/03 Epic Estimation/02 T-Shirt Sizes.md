#### Estimation in T-Shirt Sizes

T-Shirt sizing has one major advantage, that it can help avoid overly solutioning the Epics.  Therefore, it can be quicker.  It also has less baggage in terms of timeline as it does not have one (though we'll teach you how to do ne later).

In this method we have 5 size categories;

- XS - Extra Small
- S - Small
- M - Medium
- L - Large
- XL - Extra Large

Similar to the above a great way to estimate and create size lanes for Epic index cards as above, only using the T-Shirt size categories.

The hardest thing about T-Shirt estimates is getting started, so here's some techniques that help us;

- Scan the Epic list and find the smallest potential Epic.  That's an XS (Extra Small).  If you find that there are even smaller Epics, then consider rescaling (mode XS to S, S to M, M to L, etc)
- Pick any Epic and make that a M (Medium).  Then size all other Epics relative to that one.  If we find Epics are piling up to the left or right ot the first medium, then we might want to shift the scale.

As with estimating in developer days, reflect often, does the scale need to change, are previous assumptions still valid, do all the Mediums all look around the same size.  Remember, whatever answer you give will likely be wrong, don't sweat it, the errors will average out and the velocity we calculate later will provide a truer guide.

**What if I have an Epic that's off the scale**

Consider 1 of 2 things

 1) Break it into smaller Epics
 
 2) Move the scale

We'll talk more about how to turn these estimates into a roadmap later.
