#### Estimation in Developer Days

Without getting overly into solutioning, we need an educated guess as to how much effort is involved in each Epic.  Consider the time it would take one developer to deliver the Epic.

Provide a scale to help the team achieve this, e.g.;

- a day or less
- approximately 2 - 3 days
- approximately a week
- approximately a month
- approximately 3 months
- approximately 6 months
- etc...

Size each Epic via planning poker with the developers.  A great techniques is to create an index card per Epic, as well as each size category.  Place the size labels in lanes on a board or table.   Then get the team to place Epic cards in the lane they most feel comfortable with.  Planning Poker is a great technique to support this.

Stop to reflect every now and again.  Has anything that has been discovered effect our previous assumptions and needs to change?
