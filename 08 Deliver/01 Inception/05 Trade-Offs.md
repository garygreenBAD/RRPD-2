### Trade Offs

Trade off sliders are used to help understand our key values and enables teams to make rapid decisions based on these values.  Trade Offs are scored on a scale, e.g.;1-5, with 1 being not valued and 5 being vital.  Key items to score:

- Scope
- Time
- Cost
- Quality

Could also add:

- User experience
- Mobile readiness / responsiveness
- Speed of response
- Ease of use
- Auditability
- etc...
