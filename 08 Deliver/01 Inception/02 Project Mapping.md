### Project Mapping

The purpose of this activity is to identify the Themes, Epics and key Stories which will deliver the benefit we expect. 
Understanding the full scope of the project allows the team to confirm that the correct components are being delivered in the correct order. This prevents investing time and resource into delivering functionality that could be deferred to a later date.

Determining the project scope can initially be done be done in a number of ways - one of the simplest is via a whiteboard session.  This is where the BA works with the Product Owner (and other key members of the team) to carve the project up into business value.  

The output of identifying the project scope should be the basis of the project backlog which is usually located in both JIRA and on physical cards.

It is important to note that the "stories" in this example are **placeholders** only, i.e. no further breakdown has occurred, they don't have tasks or acceptance criteria. The purpose of determining how many stories belong to an Epic is to enable epics to be sized and split into releasable increments, e.g. Basic Login for initial MVP launch, Enhanced for R1, TouchID for R2.

One great tool to help you discover and visualise your Project's or Product's scope is the build a mindmap.  Consider the following steps:

- **Themes**: what are the key capabilities of the Product you intend to produce
- **Epics**: How might I break the Themes down to deliver incrementally
- **Stories**: Try to briefly identify any Stories that might deliver the each Epic.  These are just placeholders for now to help us understand the size of each Epic

**Key Benefits:**

- Provides a big picture view of the scope of the project
- Makes sure that the boundaries of known project scope are established with Business Owners
- Allows scope to be discussed, prioritised and apportioned to releases
- Facilitates a multi-release 'beta' approach, enables early delivery of value
