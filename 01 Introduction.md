# Introduction

Creating and evolving enterprise software products is complex and littered with many failures. Whether that be overruns or just building a product everyone hates. Even great companies can create poor software, think Apple's MobileMe, eventually replaced by iCloud.

This is a work of collaboration by many experienced enterprise software delivery professionals with decades at the coalface in the software industry and the bruises & scars to prove it. We have learnt how to apply techniques and practices to ensure we deliver the right thing, deliver it when we need it and stop doing things that will not provide the highest value.  3D Agile is a set tool kits that help organisations become more Agile and are more ready for the challenges of the post Internet boom and a world of digital disruption.  Such tools including; VMOST (Vision, Missions, Objectives, Strategies and Tactics), PTEST (Product, Theme, Epic, Story & Task), RRPD (Rapid, Repeatable & Predictable Delivery) as well at Blended Agile Delivery's Values and principles.

3D Agile is also part of a wider eco system of tool kits & frameworks called Blended Agile Delivery or BAD.  See <http://bad.tools> for more information.

Our aim is to deliver awesome software that delights our customers. Not only that, but to avoid delivering poor user experiences, that on paper seemed a good idea, but once launched would fail to capture and engage our customers. We call this a **No More Pet Projects** approach and use a variety of techniques to avoid this.

RRPD consists of a core set of 5 values and 6 principles as well as 5 key steps to follow, tried and tested tips and techniques from highly successful professionals, many not from us, as well as experiments that you can try to help you better understand your environment and how to apply a Lean / Agile delivery approach to getting great software products out to your customers.

One point to stress; this is a journey, not a destination. You cannot read this book and be an expert, even if you implement the tools in this book a few times and get some success. We, including the authors, are all continually learning and adapting. What may work in one situation, may not in another and we need to be able to adapt to each situation and context. 3D Agile will help with suggestions and tools that you can try, but context, culture and environment is key to finding the right tool to use and how to apply it.

> **Please Note:** This is intended as a guide, not to be implemented by route. The creators and founders of the Blended Agile Delivery toolkit value pragmatic adoption of tools and techniques and experimentation to help understand each specific environment's challenges and potential solutions.

Much of the Blended Agile Delivery toolkit leverages the learning from leading practitioners and thinkers across the globe. Where we do, we'll call that out and point you in their direction for more information.
