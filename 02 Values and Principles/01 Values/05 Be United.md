### Be United

We are one team, with one purpose, to deliver great products that delight our customers, warring departments and precious silos kill team productivity and purpose.

> _"Left to themselves the components of a system (silos) become selfish and competitive and this behaviour has a destructive effect on the system"_ **- W. Edward Demming**

Business and IT are one unit, not two. IT's prime objective is to further and influence business strategies and objectives, whilst at the same time, be good custodian of business technology. We are not separate, we are the same and need to work together daily and with our customers and stakeholders to deliver the best possible solutions we can.

Equally, great IT teams are units of of multi-skilled professionals who adapt to incoming work, are not precious about their core skills and able to muck in as needed to further the objectives and goals of the team and business. This means that we need teams of "Generalising specialists" that have mastery over a set of core skills, but are also able to be practitioners of other skills that support the team.

Lastly, we believe in communities of practice that help share both success and failure and build and evolve practices and tool kits to support their practitioners. We believe in no best practice, just good practices that will evolve and develop over time. Communities are used to foster communication, coaching, pairing and innovation. They are hierarchy-less and blameless.
