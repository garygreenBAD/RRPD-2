### Be Transparent

Transparency, honesty and visibility are core to Blended Agile Delivery. Many of the tools and techniques are crafted to help promote this and act as office and virtual information radiators. Software delivery has long been dogged with barriers from preventing engineers and technologists from being honest with our business partners. Equally, this has lead to unfortunate consequences from our partners where trust is eroded, then partnership, then empowerment.

We should not fear an honest conversation!

> **Example:** We were asked to plan a Â£17m programme and come up with and end date for a customer, using a new set of teams that had never worked together before, new technology never used before and at a scale never experiencd by the business. We had to be honest, We could create a structure and roadmap, but not date. We had no empirical metrics or past history to provide guidance on velocity or pace. We had to have that honest conversation and agree to a three month experiment. Let the teams work on the backlog for three months so we could gather metrics and foster a culture of continual improvement. It worked, after three months we had empirical data to inform us of what we could really achieve.

Transparency has another positive consequence; it builds trust. If we have a culture of experimentation and continuous improvement, we should not fear others see us, at times, stumble, as long as we learn from it and alter path (more on this later).
