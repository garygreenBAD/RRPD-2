### Be Empowered

In the Blended Agile Delivery framework, we believe that ideas, answers and innovation comes from everyone, not just lucky few. Much of the 21st centuries organisations are built on concepts from the Victorian era, such as Taylor's Scientific Method for management, developed in the last two decades of the 19th century.

Tailor believed that thinking and working should be separated and the art of the manager was to get the ideas of the thinkers into the hands of the workers as efficiently as possible. These were days of an educated elite and an uneducated majority. It was an age of industrialisation where previously artisan skills were standardised and automated on an epic scale. This meant the elite designed and built machines that could be operated, sometimes at great risk, by the majority. We see it today with Architecture teams separated from delivery (sometimes called ivory tower architecture), with separate design teams from delivery team and with Project Managers micro-managing teams and team members.

You may have also seen product team filling in forms or documents and handing over to IT to deliver. This is a form of Taylorism where we demote our creative teams to simply order takers with little or no opportunity to partner or innovate.

> _"We (The East) will win and you (The West) will lose. You cannot do anything about it, because your failure is an internal disease. Your companies are based on Taylor's principles. Worse, your heads are Taylorized, too. You firmly believe that sound management means executives on one side and workers on the other, on one side men who think, and on the other side men who can only work. For you, management is the art of smoothly transferring the executive's' ideas to the workers' hands"_ **- Konosuke Matsushita - Founder of Panasonic**

Now the environment has changed. We have an educated majority and an industry full of talented, intelligent people educated to our highest levels, with degrees, masters and PHDs. We are not operating machines, toiling with manual labour. We are engaged in cognitive creation, where every piece of work it unique. Taylor's principles simply do not work when applied to this context.

Consider also the work of Dan Pink (<http://www.danpink.com/>), a noted economist and author who developed the book "Drive, the surprising truth about what motivates us". He presented the research of many prominent psychologists, scientists and economics leaders and cites, with evidence, autonomy as one of the three intrinsic motivators for cognitive workers (along with purpose and mastery). More on motivation techniques later.
