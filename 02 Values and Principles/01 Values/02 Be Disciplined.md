### Be Disciplined

We use discipline to drive common good practices and capabilities. We leverage elements from existing frameworks & tools like; Scrum, Kanban, Scrumban, Disciplined Agile (DAD), Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Large Scale Scrum (LeSS), Spotify and Nexus to help forge that structure. We make these to construct a lightweight and flexible to suit each organisation.

We value clear accountabilities but share responsibilities. That means there is always an accountable team member, but they don't necessarily deliver the item. They could facilitate collaboration and teamwork to make that happen.

We promote a healthy balance between consistency and innovation, holding a core set of common practices but consciously innovating and experimenting with new ideas and approaches to help evolve those practices and learn.

Blended Agile Delivery strives for predictability, but without buffers, padding or gaming the system. Product delivery is complex and unpredictable at times increasing variability in delivery, Blended Agile Delivery makes that visible and plan for it by decomposition of risk and front load risk into Discovery and Inception.
