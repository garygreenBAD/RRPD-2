### Be Aware

Blended Agile Delivery values awareness (environment, culture, competitors, customer & team needs) to drive delivery and ensure we build the right products for our customers. We use tools such as:

- Market insights
- Analysis on our competitors
- Innovation incubators (such as; hackathons, ShipIt days & FedEx days)
- Minimal Viable Product (MVP), what is the minimum we can do to maximise customer feedback
- Use Cost of Delay (CoD) to help Product Owners, Product Managers and Squads make informed decisions and prioritise early realisation of value and return on investment

Every deliverable in the Product Backlog needs to have value, either immediate or enabled future value, otherwise why are we delivering it? We need to be able to measure that value either as commercial value (revenue or profit) or relative to other Product Backlog Items (PBIs).
