### Structured

Blended Agile Delivery believes that structure is needed to promote autonomy & purpose and also accountability & responsibility. One difference. structure is not hierarchical like in SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) which can cause a separation between thinkers and doers, rather RRPD utilised autonomous units working in coordination to a common goal.

Key structural elements are based on the highly successful Spotify model with concepts of autonomous Squads grouped into product or value stream Tribes with Guilds acting as community of practices and Chapters acting as focus groups or core capability groups (e.g.; Testing, UX, Business Analysis). This also aligns to the Large Scale Scrum (LeSS) framework with Products and Product Areas and SAFe with value streams and Release Trains.

Structure allows us to scale almost indefinitely and assists with coordinating distributed teams and specialities. Structure is essential, but also evolves as the challenges and organisation evolves. We have clear accountabilities but share responsibilities.

We often use elements of the Spotify Model developed by Henrik Kniberg and Anders Ivarsson. This introduces the concept of structural elements such as; Squads, Tribes, Guilds and Chapters, more about these later.
