### Focused

The Blended Agile Delivery framework focuses on two key areas; Value and Risk. Our goal is to increase value rapidly whilst decreasing risk rapidly too. We achieve this by early and lightweight experimentation.

For example, one technique we use is the Â£50 Starbucks experiment. A small team creates paper prototypes of a proposed product or feature and takes them to the nearest busy coffee shop and offer to buy customers their coffee for 5 minutes of their time. We use this time to help validate if the prototype makes sense, is intuitive and would provide value.

Additionally, if we have new technology, we'll produce early working features to prove our pace and capability to deliver. This provide empirical data to guide our planning early on in the product's life-cycle.
