### Lean

Lean Manufacturing was developed for Toyota, formerly known as The Toyota Production System (TPS), primarily by Sakichi Toyoda, his son, Kiichiro Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno, a production engineer from the 1940s onwards. It was renamed to Lean Manufacturing in the 1990s. Put simply, Lean means the elimination of waste.

Lean Manufacturing was implemented to optimise a chain of dependent events that deliver some item of value to a customer. It was quickly adopted within the IT industry (and others) to help optimise software delivery processes, which also adopt a chain of dependent events (Requirements / Needs, technical design, development, test, make available to the customer and support)

Lean has 5 key principles:

> - Identify Value from the perspective of the customer
> - Map the Value Stream, that is, identify the steps to deliver the value to the customer
> - Create Flow, implement the value stream via closely linked steps that emphasise smooth flow to the customer
> - Establish Pull, let customers and workers pull work, rather than it be pushed onto them and overload them
> - Seek Perfection, continuously review and identify improvements to the process

Lean introduces many of the tools and concepts we will cover, for example; Kanban, principles of flow, continuous improvement, just in time, etc.
