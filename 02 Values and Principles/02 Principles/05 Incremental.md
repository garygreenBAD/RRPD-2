### Incremental

We believe in getting a product in front of our customers as soon as possible. It may have limited functionality, it may not have all the bells and whistles, but we need feedback to guide us before we move further forward and risk more expense based on potentially incorrect assumptions.

The goal of this is to learn. Consider the Innocent brand of smoothies and health foods, founded by three Cambridge University graduates in 1999.

>Before they committed to leaving their jobs, they sell their first smoothies from a stall at a music festival in London. A sign above the stall reads "Should we give up our jobs to make these smoothies?" and people are asked to throw their empties into bins marked 'Yes' or 'No'. ('Yes' wins.)

Innocent are now a significant international company providing soothies around the world.  Source: <http://www.innocentdrinks.co.uk/us/our-story>

Consider the work of Henrik Kniberg and his 2016 blog "Making sense of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) â€“ and why I prefer Earliest Testable/Usable/Lovable".
