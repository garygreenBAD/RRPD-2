### Pragmatic

Firstly and foremost, Blended Agile Delivery is pragmatic, it is a tool kit, not a framework to implemented by rout.  Please do not do that.  A lot of tools can be used to tighten a nut, a spanner, a socket set or an adjustable wrench, please choose what's right for you dependent on your circumstances.  Consider Blended Agile Delivery as a set of tools to try and work with the ones that fit you and your environment.
