# Step 2 - Vision - Where are we going?

Organise all work across the organisation into one coherent and prioritised backlog.

Many companies have become successful at delivering projects in a rapid, predictable and repeatable manner, but can still fail to become market leaders. Successful project delivery teams can quickly become hampered by conflicting priorities or the conflicting objectives of the management team, especially when agility enables a greater ability to pivot. If such problems are occurring then this stage attempts to rectify issues by providing: 

- A singular vision and focus from the top to the bottom of the organisation.
- Clear and measurable objectives for each business unit
- A number of areas of focus
- A prioritised list of changes encompassing delivery, people and processes, marketing and communications.

_This stage can be seen as a replacement to a more traditional annual budget process and is optimised for iterative delivery, rapid feedback and a subsequently swifter decision loop that requires a shorter (quarterly) review cycle. This stage typically takes 2-3 weeks to complete._
