# The 5 Steps

There key steps are:

- **Define** - Where are we now?
- **Vision** - Where are we going?
- **Plan** - When and how will we get there?
- **Discover** - Is the idea viable?
- **Deliver**, Operate and Evolve - Build an alpha, beta and beyond

![Overview](https://github.com/bad-tools/3d.tools/raw/master/RRPD/images/figures/5steps.png)

Each step aims to reduce risk and maximise value delivered through ensuring that:

- A company is aware of it's challenges and opportunities based upon factual and evidential data.
- A company backlog can be formed and it can be effectively prioritised to reduce risk and deliver value in the shortest achievable amount of time.
- The company backlog factors in business process, operational, marketing, brand, comms, etc. changes as well as project deliverables, i.e. that the wider impact of delivery is understood.
- Ideas can be implemented in a rapid and cost effective manner to prove the viability of the solution, i.e. if something isn't going to work it's best to know soon, to enable funds to be allocated elsewhere. Equally, if something is incredibly successful to enable delivery work to maximise value rather than moving on to the next thing according to previously agreed timelines.
- All deliverables are built with their operation and on-going evolution factored into the plan, i.e. delivery prove the initial technical approach and that the team has successfully formed (Alpha release), followed by a series of feature releases to enable rapid customer feedback to be obtained (Beta releases).

The three main areas of focus (in order of importance) for RRPD are to:

- Delivery Value quickly - the process of delivering the right thing, in the right way (quality focused) and quickly.
- Reduce "Product Risk" - the risk of delivering the wrong thing.
- Provide increasing accuracy in estimation as each step progresses.

> RRPD isn't rigid! **Not all of the steps are mandatory!** It is our opinion, based upon experience, that following the steps will lead to the most optimal outcome, but it's not always pragmatic to do so. RRPD can be easily tailored to help with a Project Rescue, Portfolio Planning, Organisational Optimisation and Greenfield Development.

## What

**BAD**, stands for **Blended Agile Delivery** and is a tool kit, rather than a framework. **RRPD**, which stands for **Rapid, Repeatable, Predictable Delivery** is a core module of the BAD tool kit. RRPD itself is a tool kit comprising the 5 steps outlined above.

Rather than reinvent the wheel we've taken elements of existing and proven agile frameworks such as Scrum, Scrumban, Kanban, SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework), VMOST, LeSS (Large Scale Scrum), Spotify and DAD (Disciplined Agile Delivery) and put them together in a logical order, along with case studies and training packs to enable you to remedy issues associated in the various steps between Definition through to Service Transition or Product Evolution.

RRPD has a governance structure and a set of value and principles that we believe are necessary to achieve success. They are people orientated because people deliver successful projects, not processes. RRPD is a tool kit for this very reason and its value, principles and governance structure exist to assist successful delivery, hopefully preventing many of the "off piste" activities that can lead to failure.

## Why

Software delivery is complex, customer needs are difficult to gauge, competitor movements are difficult to predict and commercial environments are subject to change & disruption.  RRPD focuses on value and risk, it's aim to maximise value and minimise risk with low cost experimentation and measurement before committing significant cost and resource.

## Who

RRPD works best with teams of a set size, known as squads, akin to those first introduced by Henrik Knigberg in his article about [Scaling Agile @ Spotify](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1018963/Articles/SpotifyScaling.pdf).
