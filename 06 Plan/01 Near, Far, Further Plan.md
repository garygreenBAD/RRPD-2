## The Near, Far, Further Plan

During the previous stage, the output of the VMOST sessions will have provided an unordered backlog with VROM cost and benefit estimates. Some basic prioritisation will have occurred as part of VMOST as a number of tactics won't have made the cut, i.e. they will be "below the line" on the VMOST Canvas.

Near, far, further planning involves taking the tactics agreed as being "in scope" and plotting them on to a roadmap, ordering in terms of their Cost of Delay to ensure delivery is focused upon achieving the highest value/return. This enables:

- The backlog to be visualised in terms of which tactics are likely to be delivered in the next 0-6 months (Near), 6-12 months (Far), 12-18 months (Further). This facilitates conversation across Business and IT Owners to ensure priority calls are correct, i.e. the order of delivery is optimal.
- Outliers/problems to be identified, i.e. although the prioritised order is correct, that delivery in 12-18 months isn't an option which frames subsequent conversations regarding how many teams to apply to the backlog from which to derive the Mission Plan.
