## Visibility

Designed to provide visibility across all strategic deliverables to:

- Provide a representation of timelines
- Visualise dependencies
- Visualise the type and number of changes per strategy, which enables wider technical and operational work to be effectively co-ordinated.
- Enables quick decisions when work needs to 'pivot', e.g. to fail fast or to chase successes.

## Terms of reference

- **Vision** - An aspirational description of what an organisation would like to achieve or accomplish in the mid-term or long-term future; intended to serve as a clear guide for choosing current and future courses of action.

- **Mission** - A written declaration of a core purpose and focus that normally remains unchanged over time (scope of annual budget). Properly crafted mission statements:

  1. Serve as filters to separate what is important from what is not
  2. Clearly state which markets will be served and how
  3. Communicate a sense of intended direction to the entire organisation - should fold back into the wider vision.

  A mission is different from a vision in that the former is the cause and the latter is the effect; a mission is something to be accomplished whereas a vision is something to be pursued for that accomplishment.
 
- **Strategy(s)** - A discrete area of focus, where work is aligned/co-ordinated to meet one of more objectives, e.g. Transition customers from call centre interactions to online self service channels to reduce call volumes, delays in resolving issues and to improve ongoing two-way dialogue and personlisation interactions. Each strategy will have a set allocation of budget to enable it to achieve its stated benefits.

- **Tactics** - The actual changes. Tactics are not solely product changes, i.e. areas of feature development and release. For instance building a new Online Self Service capability might have a wider impact, e.g.

  1. OSS product requires a product change.
  2. A KPI is to reduce contacts to the Call Centre, which reduces staffing levels.
  3. Customers need to be informed of the new functionality and training guides are to be made available via the FAQ section and YouTube tutorials.
  4. The new system can't be supported on the current legacy hardware as the scale of usage is predicted to be far higher than current call volumes.

All of the above tactics are needed to deliver the wider strategy of moving customers to online channels. If one tactic doesn't deliver, the wider strategy could fail, hence it is important to visualise the 'whole deliverable' against measurable KPIs to focus and align company effort.
