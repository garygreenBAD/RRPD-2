## Mission Planner

The Mission Planner allows a product area to understand how it's mission is going  to be delivered.

Following Near, Far, Further planning where the number squads have been determined to deliver the backlog, this step helps to show exactly what is happening and when, to allow dependencies to be mapped and the cost and benefit of the backlog to be applied against each strategy, which allows it to be tied back to the VMOST board and validated on a quarterly basis.

### The Detail

The mission planner is ordered into strategies, with each tactic required to deliver the strategy placed in chronological order.

- Each tactic will have a known ROM cost and benefit documented.
- The sum of all tactics on the backlog will be segregated by strategy to provide a strategy level cost and benefit.  This allows the effectiveness of each strategy to be measured on an 'at least' quarterly basis against the stated objectives on the Mission Board.
- The benefits of a tactic should be measurable after an initial release (MVP), i.e. it should be possible to determine that x% of benefits are being achieved prior to commencing subsequent delivery / phases. This should also allow progress to be reported back to enable funding for the next phase to be released.  
  - Fail fast - This allows failed deliveries to be stopped in favour of others to minimise cost and maximise revenue. It also allows the area to learn about why problems have occurred and to improve as a consequence.
  - Chase successes - The initial release might yield a 'cash cow'. This allows the Product Area to determine whether to park other deliverables in favour of one that is yielding a high return.
