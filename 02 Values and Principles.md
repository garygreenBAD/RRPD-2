# Values and Principles

Before rushing to implement the tools, techniques and practices in this book, first we must consider the foundations. These are the values and principles that underpin the Blended Agile Delivery framework.

> _A "principle" is acceptance of something as truth or a belief that a certain standard or rule is not up for debate. A "value" is a person's personal belief for or against something._

**Please Note:** If you do not live by the values and principles we state here, then please do not attempt to use the Blended Agile Delivery framework. You may get some success, but will not be truly successful and we desperately want to help you succeed.
