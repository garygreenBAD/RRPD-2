# Step 3 - Plan - When and how will we get there?

Prioritise work into an ordinal backlog based upon "Cost of Delay", then apply to teams to visualise the pattern of delivery.

During the previous stage the output of the VMOST sessions will have provided an unordered backlog with VROM cost and benefit estimates. Some basic prioritisation will have occurred as part of VMOST as a number of tactics won't have made the cut, i.e. they will be "below the line" on the VMOST Canvas.

This stage focuses upon the tactics considered to be "in scope" for delivery (usually for the next financial year or another clearly defined period, e.g. the next 12-18 months) and has 2 elements:

- **Near, far, further planning: Tactics are plotted on to a roadmap and ordered in terms of their Cost of Delay to ensure delivery is focused upon achieving the highest value/return.**
- **Mission Planning: The ordinal backlog created during Near, far, further planning can be applied to squads or project teams to visualise the wider pattern of delivery across the portfolio.**

_This stage enables Business and IT Owners to rapidly understand high-level timelines for delivery, with the aim to quickly highlight outliers (i.e. "we need tactic X to commence sooner than 6 months") and to understand the which teams or delivery partners will be implementing the changes and when. Again this should quickly highlight problems in terms of team structure, capability, dependencies etc. This stage shouldn't take more than a couple of days to complete._

The Planning stage needs input from Heads of Business Unit, Product Owners, Technical Leads / Architects and Business Analysts in order to complete a VMOST Canvas (Near, far, further plan).

The subsequent VMOST Canvas (Mission Planner) follows on from the Near, Far, Further Plan will involve the same contributors with additional input from the wider delivery personnel to allocate teams.
