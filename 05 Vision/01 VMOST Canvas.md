## VMOST Canvas

The VMOST Canvas, also known as a Mission Board, allows a company vision to be documented in a highly visible way, which facilitates effective, focused and rapid interaction across teams from Board level through to Delivery.

VMOST stands for:

- **V**ision - A place where...
- **M**ission(s) - How we'll get there
- **O**bjectives - How we know we got there
- **S**trategies - Areas of focus
- **T**actics - Actual changes to implement

A vision can have a number of missions. Each mission must have:

- A stated and measurable **benefit** and **cost**.
- A number of **SMART objectives** with which to measure and validate all deliverables to swiftly determine their success or failure.
- A number of **strategies** and associated **tactics**
