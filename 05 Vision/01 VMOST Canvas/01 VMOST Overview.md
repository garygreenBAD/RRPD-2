### Visibility

Designed to provide visibility in each product area of:

- Portfolio level planning by strategy
- Visualisation of dependencies
- Types of change visualised
- Timelines, decision points and opportunities (pivot points) highlighted

### How it works

**Technology owners** - usually Architecture and Engineering Managers work with their teams (no more than 3 days) to size up the tactics per strategy. This is based upon:

The current Technology City Plan:

- what are the high-level changes
- how might they affect the current estate
- what is the estimated size of the work based upon 'yesterdays weather', e.g. Tactic A feels like a quarter of all of the work we'll complete this year, and is a similar size to Project B that we did last year, so we think it's 250 points.
- what org changes might be needed, i.e. new staff/contractors/delivery partners, training, licenses etc.

**Business Owners** - usually Product Owners, Insight and Contact Centre managers size up what changes to customer behaviour are likely based upon the proposed tactics. They should discuss:

- How to measure each change and to align this to the agreed Objectives (KPIs).
- What subsequent changes are needed such as training, marketing etc and whether these create other tactics.
- Determine how their points equate to the uplift in revenue or cost savings, e.g. 1000 points = £10 million for the product area. The delivery of the Online Self Service strategy is worth 400 points or £4 million to the company. This is because:
  - The Product Change tactic will enable £2 million in estimated savings in contacts to Customer Care.
  - The Marketing tactic will bring in £1.5 million through people using this channel where the app makes cross-sell and upsell easier.
  - The Technology Change tactic will enable £500k in annual savings in platform cost through moving to open-source database software rather than licensed proprietary kit - Obviously Technology would have brought this to the attention of the Product Owners.
 
The viability of each strategy is assessed by determining the stated benefits versus the cost, e.g.
1) Agree initial estimates for Product Area - The technology delivery and operational budget for the area is £1 million for 2015.  The target profit uplift for the product area is £10 million for 2015.
2) Calculate the cost and benefit for each strategy to achieve the stated benefit within the agreed cost, e.g.
The cost of delivery for the Online Self Service strategy is 250 points, or £250k. The target uplift in profit is 400 points, or £4 million, which represents a high ROI.

Each tactic should be released iteratively, where possible. This will allow the stated costs and benefits to be measured against the Mission Planner to show whether delivery is going to plan, as things change, can be more complicated than envisaged etc. This provides the ability to 'pivot', i.e. if a change is not achieving the target benefit or is costing more to deliver or operate, it should be straightforward to see this after an initial release, providing the changes are properly tracked and are measurable.

### Terms of reference

- **Vision** - An aspirational description of what an organisation would like to achieve or accomplish in the mid-term or long-term future; intended to serve as a clear guide for choosing current and future courses of action.

- **Mission** - A written declaration of a core purpose and focus that normally remains unchanged over time (scope of annual budget). Properly crafted mission statements:

  1. Serve as filters to separate what is important from what is not
  2. Clearly state which markets will be served and how
  3. Communicate a sense of intended direction to the entire organisation - should fold back into the wider vision.

  A mission is different from a vision in that the former is the cause and the latter is the effect; a mission is something to be accomplished whereas a vision is something to be pursued for that accomplishment.
 
- **Strategy(s)** - A discrete area of focus, where work is aligned/co-ordinated to meet one of more objectives, e.g. Transition customers from call centre interactions to online self service channels to reduce call volumes, delays in resolving issues and to improve ongoing two-way dialogue and personalised customer interaction. Each strategy will have a set allocation of budget to enable it to achieve its stated benefits.

- **Tactics** - The actual changes. Tactics are not solely product changes, i.e. areas of feature development and release. For instance building a new Online Self Service (OSS) capability might have a wider impact, e.g.

  1. OSS product requires a product change - Orange Card (Product Change - Development)
  2. A KPI is to reduce contacts to the Call Centre, which reduces staffing levels - Green Card (Process or Org change)
  3. Customers need to be informed of the new functionality and training guides are to be made available via the FAQ section and YouTube tutorials - Yellow Card (Marketing change)
  4. The new system can't be supported on the current legacy hardware as the scale of predicted usage is far higher than current call volumes - Blue Card (Technology Change - new system)

All of the above tactics are needed to deliver the wider strategy of moving customers to online channels. If one tactic doesn't deliver, the wider strategy could fail, hence it is important to visualise the 'whole deliverable against measurable KPIs to focus and align company effort.
