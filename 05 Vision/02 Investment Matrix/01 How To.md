### How it works

- All work already has a cost and benefit point score determined during the creation of the VMOST Canvas. This allows tactics to be plotted according to
  - **VROM Cost** - e.g. 125 points
  - **VROM Benefit** - e.g. 450 points
  - **Estimated Size/Risk/Complexity** - Denoted by circle size, again in ratio to other work.
  - **Colours** - Each colour denotes a discrete project. This can be useful to show if a project looks too large in comparison to the others in the portfolio, i.e. we haven't sensibly split it into phases.

The initial investment matrix diagram shows how the 'Blue Project' is substantially larger than the other deliverables. This might be OK, but equally it is also the project incurring the highest cost, which also attracts the highest chance of costly failure. A better option would be to split this work into phased releases to enable a release occur more rapidly, from which we have validate its success before starting the subsequent phase.

The second diagram 'optimised investment matrix' shows the effect of splitting the blue project into phases. It also shows that phase 2 might need a rethink as it holds the majority of the cost of delivery for the lowest benefit.
