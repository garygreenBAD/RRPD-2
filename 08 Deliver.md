# Step 5 - Deliver, Operate and Evolve

Quickly prototype, rapidly launch an Alpha and then deliver many short iterations producing a potentially consumable or beta solution each iteration.

We've created a hybrid based upon Disciplined Agile Delivery. There still are three distinct, named phases, reflecting the agile coordinate-collaborate-conclude (3C) rhythm which are: 

- Inception
- Elaboration & Construction
- End of Life

There are two major differences between raw DAD and the RRPD hybrid. Firstly, we've extended Construction to include Elaboration in the form of an explicit Alpha release. Secondly, as Transition occurs as part of the flow of Construction, the focus moves to Product evolution to recognise that not all project deliverables will be handed over to a Service or Support function. At the point when there's no more value to be delivered End of Life activities will occur. In a DevOps or Product-centric world it is highly likely that products will evolve.
