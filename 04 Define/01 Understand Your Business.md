## Understand Your Business!

Without a solid understanding of your company, it's competitive landscape, customers, its strategic capabilities and strengths and weaknesses, it is not possible to fully define its current status from which to build its Vision, Mission, Objectives, Strategies and Tactics to feed into strategic budgetary and/or delivery processes. This stage outputs a company reference model through the creation of:

- **A business model canvas**
- **A competitive landscape**
- **Personas**
- **A Business process map**
- **A technology city plan**

> *This stage can take between 2-8 weeks to complete, the variance in length due to the high dependency upon wide-ranging input across the company.*
