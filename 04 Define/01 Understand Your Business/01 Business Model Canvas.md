## Business Model Canvas

The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management and lean start-up template for developing new or documenting existing business models. It is a visual chart with elements describing a firm's or product's value proposition, infrastructure, customers, and finances. It assists firms in aligning their activities by illustrating potential trade-offs.

Formal descriptions of the business become the building blocks for its activities. Many different business conceptualisations exist; The work and thesis of Alexander Osterwald (2010,[3] 2004[5]) proposes a single reference model based on the similarities of a wide range of business model conceptualisations. With his business model design template, an enterprise can easily describe their business model.
