### Customers

- **Customer Segments:** To build an effective business model, a company must identify which customers it tries to serve. Various sets of customers can be segmented based on the different needs and attributes to ensure appropriate implementation of corporate strategy meets the characteristics of selected group of clients. The different types of customer segments include:

  - **Mass Market:** There is no specific segmentation for a company that follows the Mass Market element as the organization displays a wide view of potential clients. e.g. Car
  - **Niche Market:** Customer segmentation based on specialized needs and characteristics of its clients. e.g. Rolex
  - **Segmented:** A company applies additional segmentation within existing customer segment. In the segmented situation, the business may further distinguish its clients based on gender, age, and/or income.
  - **Diversify:** A business serves multiple customer segments with different needs and characteristics.
  - **Multi-Sided Platform / Market:** For a smooth day-to-day business operation, some companies will serve mutually dependent customer segment. A credit card company will provide services to credit card holders while simultaneously assisting merchants who accept those credit cards.

- **Channels:** A company can deliver its value proposition to its targeted customers through different channels. Effective channels will distribute a company’s value proposition in ways that are fast, efficient and cost effective. An organization can reach its clients either through its own channels (store front), partner channels (major distributors), or a combination of both.

- **Customer Relationships:** To ensure the survival and success of any businesses, companies must identify the type of relationship they want to create with their customer segments. Various forms of customer relationships include:
  - **Personal Assistance:** Assistance in a form of employee-customer interaction. Such assistance is performed either during sales, after sales, and/or both.
  - **Dedicated Personal Assistance:** The most intimate and hands on personal assistance where a sales representative is assigned to handle all the needs and questions of a special set of clients.
  - **Self Service:** The type of relationship that translates from the indirect interaction between the company and the clients. Here, an organization provides the tools needed for the customers to serve themselves easily and effectively.
  - **Automated Services:** A system similar to self-service but more personalized as it has the ability to identify individual customers and his/her preferences. An example of this would be Amazon.com making book suggestion based on the characteristics of the previous book purchased.
  - **Communities:** Creating a community allows for a direct interaction among different clients and the company. The community platform produces a scenario where knowledge can be shared and problems are solved between different clients.
  - **Co-creation:** A personal relationship is created through the customer’s direct input in the final outcome of the company’s products/services.
