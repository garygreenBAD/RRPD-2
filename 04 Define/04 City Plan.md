## A technology city plan

The city plan shows:

- Shows the entire technical estate in one diagram
- A high level map of all services and aggregated components.
- It should show all interaction points between services
- It should be RAG statused, to denote which components:
- Are marked to be deprecated
- Are end of life
- Have performance, scaling, security issues
- Are out of support
 
This enables a technical evolution plan to be drafted in line with wider business strategies to ensure that operation and support is factored as an equal member in delivery and focus isn't solely upon new features. A very basic example is shown opposite.
