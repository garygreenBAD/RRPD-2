### How it works

he city plan is a working model depicting the current state of the technology estate, sometimes known as a 'Current Mode of Operation' or CMO.

When a new product or service is to be created, the city plan allows architects to determine the high-level requirements and the impact of these changes upon the current estate from which an initial t-shirt sized estimate can be derived, with 3 parameters:

1. Size/Scope - Small, Medium, Large or Extra-Large
1. Risk/Complexity - Low, Medium, High
1. Confidence - High, Medium, Low (usually in terms of happy, average or sad faces).

This allows all work to be marked up with these 3 parameters.

A technical impact heat map can then be created to show the before and after view of the city plan, which should be version controlled and commented to capture changes as they happen. An Architect/Tech Lead is typically responsible for keeping this up-to-date.

> _During an annual budget phase the Technology City Plan is particularly important as if all changes are marked against it, this will allow a future view to be drafted to show to intended future state of the technology estate, sometimes known as a 'Future Mode of Operation' or FMO. A very basic example is shown opposite._
