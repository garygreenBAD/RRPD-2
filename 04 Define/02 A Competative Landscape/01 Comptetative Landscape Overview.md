### Definition

A form of analysis that helps a business identify its primary online and offline rivals. For example, a competitive landscape analysis might start with an attempt to identify and understand competitors, followed by an analysis of their strengths and weaknesses and how the target business can improve upon what its competition is doing.

### Data to understand

What internal data have you been collecting to understand your users? What do they like, what fell flat, why?

- Competitors and partners – What they doing?  And Why?
- What’s the happening in the wider marketplace and within your specific industry? 

What Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental factors which need to be considered?
All of the above help to define the competitive landscape for any company which helps to visualise the opportunities available.

### Outputs

To understand which ideas may be worth progressing, organisations use data and insight to identify the potential opportunities for growth. Insight based opportunities originate from an understanding of the what's happening outside the organisation. These can be represented as a series of 5 concentric circles, with each layer focusing on a different aspect of the wider world.

#### Layer 0 - Corporate Insight

Insight usually starts with the data that the organisation already controls - for example metrics such as margin per customer, drop out rates, etc. This provides a view of the world which is heavily skewed towards the organisation's products and target demographics. Whilst this information does provide some benefit during ideation and product development, it requires information obtained from external data (see layers 1-4) to be truly useful in understanding the context and extent of the potential opportunities

#### Layer 1 - Competitor & Partner Insight

This looks at the companies who influence us – either because we are dependent on them to offer our product or because they are trying to win market share from us. This analysis provides the organisation with a view of what those companies are working on / releasing to their customers. This should relate to what they feel is important and where they want to take their company.  The competitor list must be constantly assessed to remain fresh and cater for new companies entering the marketplace. Methodologies for understanding this layer include techniques such as Porter's 5 forces.

#### Layer 2 - Market Place Insight

Companies operate within one (or many) market places within a particular industry.  Analysis at this level would likely be trend analysis using groups of competitors. For example “What is happening in the world of car loans?” or “Are people playing bingo on social media?”

#### Layer 3 - Industry Insight

Shows the directional trends of various themes within the industries that the organisation operates in.  These changes may relate to what customers are wanting or how companies within the market respond to external influences. It is important that all industries that the organisation operate in are monitored to achieved optimal results, not just their primary industry.

#### Layer 4 - Global Insight

Gives information and knowledge relating to the wider landscape that we operate in. This would include looking at holistic trends such as Population demographics in the UK, Government Policies and Social trends. There may be some overlap with the industry insight (such as emerging markets and trends in customers) but generally speaking this would be a higher level analysis with a wider remit. [PESTLE Analysis](http://pestleanalysis.com/what-is-pestle-analysis/) is an example of the type of understanding which occurs within this layer.
